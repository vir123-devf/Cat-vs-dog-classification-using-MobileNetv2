# 🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Image Classifier

This project builds a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of cats and dogs. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn from image data and accurately distinguish between the two classes.

## 📌 Key Features

- Binary image classification: Cat 🐱 vs Dog 🐶  
- Uses CNN architecture for feature extraction and classification  
- Data preprocessing, augmentation, and normalization  
- Trained and evaluated using TensorFlow/Keras  
- Achieves strong accuracy on unseen images
